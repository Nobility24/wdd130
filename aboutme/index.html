    <p>Hi everyone, May I intoduce myself. I am an early 40s gentleman with 
        a spirit of a teenanger. My heart was once shattered by devorce
        several years ago but I am back on my feet again. I am currently dating 
        a beautiful woman, Jabu who we are preparing for baptism soon. And what 
        will follow after that is indeed everyone's guess, till eternity. I 
        have a 12 year old daughter and a 4 year old son.</p>
        <p>I served a mission 20 years ago here in South Africa, Cape Town 
        where I also currently reside, that was a year after I was baptised 
        as member of the Church in my home city and country, Blantyre Malawi 
        in 2002.</p>
        <p>Lately, I have been in between jobs until I took a leap of faith to 
        study with BYU Pathway. I did not have a prefered choice for a course 
        prior to taking Pathway-Connect but somewhere along the journey I got 
        the impressions to pursuit Web Development.</p>
        <p>I am looking to learn from all you and I hope that I add my two 
        senses in contribution. Thank you.</p>
